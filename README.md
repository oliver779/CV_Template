# CV_Template
This is a professional CV template that I developed and used for job applications. It has been instrumental in helping me secure a position at a FAANG company. The template is designed to be clear, concise, and impactful, highlighting key skills and experiences effectively. Feel free to customize it to suit your needs and best showcase your qualifications.

The LaTeX code has inserts with quotation marks around places where the information should be placed: 'NAME AND SURNAME', please delete the quoation marks and put in your own information.
